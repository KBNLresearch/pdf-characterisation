## About these files

- lindlar-tunnat-wilson-rendering.csv: simplified Adobe Professional XI Pro (11.0.15) rendering status of all files in Lindlar-Tunnat-Wilson dataset. Derived from the spreadsheet that is part of [original dataset](https://www.radar-service.eu/radar/en/dataset/JtlOdwQquZWDqQdq). The values in column "Adobe Professional XI Pro (11.0.15) - can file be opened?" of the original spreadsheet were simplified into the three categories of the "rendersInAcrobat" column.

- lindlar-tunnat-wilson-jhove-vera-rendering.csv: same as above, but includes added columns with JHOVE 1.28.0 validation status and VeraPDF 1.22.3 parse errors and log warnings.
